        My website will be a logo making site. Here, people can commission their own custom logo for their brand, business, or website. Unlike most cheap logo maker sites, all logos commissioned here will be carefully designed to fit the needs of the consumer. Cheap logo making sites exist, but the logos created there are impersonal, cheap looking, and can easily be overlooked by the very people the logo is supposed to attract. Here, however, our logos are very personal and are made to stand out. Plus, full ownership of the logo goes to the one who commissioned the logo’s creation, so you don’t have to worry about copyright infringement or ownership disputes. We not only offer custom logos for those who need them, but we also offer pre-made logos that can be bought on our online marketplace. You can also browse the catalog of examples we have on how our logos look digitally and physically.

      <h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
      <p>
        Q. Are our commissions free?
        A. We do not offer free commissions. However, all commissions require a one time fee and pricing can vary depending on the consumer’s needs.

        Q. Will the artist have to be paid royalty fees when the logo is used?
        A. No, all you have to do is pay the one time fee and full ownership becomes yours.

        Q. Where can we commission a logo?
        A. You can contact us via our main site, or you can follow us and contact us through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter(‘X’), or Instagram.

        Q. What if we are unsatisfied with the logo created?
        A. If you are unsatisfied with the product then you can request a full refund, ask the artist to edit the design, or have the artist redo the logo until you are satisfied. 

        Q. How much does it cost to commission a logo?
        A. As mentioned before, pricing varies depending on the needs of the consumer. However, most logos typically have a starting price of $50-$200.
